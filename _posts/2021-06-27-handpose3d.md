Most machine learning research on human body keypoints estimation deal with 2D coordinate estimations. This is because the mathematics require at least two cameras viewing the same point to triangulate a 3D coorindate. Additionally, the cameras must be calibrated and their relative orientations and positions known. This requirement is rather stringent. On the other hand, if we can detect 2D coordinates of a points from two camera views, we can simply triangulate the 3D coorindate using camera calibration parameters. In this post, I show how to do this using mediapipe's hand keypoints detector. The code for this demo is uploaded to my repository: [click here](https://github.com/TemugeB/handpose3d).
