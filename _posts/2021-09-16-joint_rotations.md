This post gives a general strategy on how to calculate joint angles from 3D body poses given in world coordinates. If you need to get 3D body poses, check my post [here](https://temugeb.github.io/python/computer_vision/2021/09/14/bodypose3d.html). 

There are three main points on how to calculate the joint angles.  
1. Obtaining a rotation matrix that rotates one vector to another.  
2. Decomposing rotation matrix into rotation sequence along major axes. For example ZXY or XYZ rotation orders.
3. Setting up basic body pose. Also known as T pose.

**1. Obtaining a rotation matrix that rotates one vector to another.**

We can rotate a general vector **A** into **B** by defining a normal direction given **A**x**B** and then rotating along this new axis, as shown in Fig. 1. Our strategy is then to change coorindates to the one defined by **A**, **B**, **A**x**B**, rotate in this basis and then rotate back to original basis.

We can define a new basis by making **A** a unit vector and taking the rejection of **B** onto **A** as the second axis. The third axis is simply defined as **A**x**B** normalized. This will allow us to write down the change of basis rotation matrix. Once the coordinates are aligned, we can simply rotate along the **A**x**B** direction, which is given by Rz rotation matrix. Note however that we don't need to know the rotation angle, since cos(theta)
and sin(theta) are simply dot and cross products of the normalized **A** and **B** vectors. The code below calculates the rotation matrix necessary to rotate some vector **A** into **B**. Notice however that they don't have to be the same length, since we normalize the vectors. 
```python 

#calculate rotation matrix to take A vector to B vector
def Get_R(A,B):

    #get unit vectors
    uA = A/np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(A)))
    uB = B/np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(B)))

    #get products
    cos_t = np.sum(uA * uB)
    sin_t = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(np.cross(uA,uB)))) #magnitude

    #get new unit vectors
    u = uA
    v = uB - np.sum(uA * uB)*uA
    v = v/np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(v)))
    w = np.cross(uA, uB)
    w = w/np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(w)))

    #get change of basis matrix
    C = np.array([u, v, w])

    #get rotation matrix in new basis
    R_uvw = np.array([[cos_t, -sin_t, 0],
                      [sin_t, cos_t, 0],
                      [0, 0, 1]])

    #full rotation matrix
    R = C.T @ R_uvw @ C
    #print(R)
    return R
```

**2. Decomposing rotation matrix into rotation sequence along major axes.**

When decomposing a rotation matrix, the order of the rotation is important. In this example, we use the ZXY order, where we rotate around Y first. The rotation matrix in this case is:

</p>

The rotation angles can be calculated from the full expansion above. For example, we see that arctan(r01/r11) gives rotation around z axis. In the same manner, all joint angles are calculated. If any other rotation order is used, then the matrix has the be rewritten with the correct order and then joint angles recalculated. Additionally, the arctan function needs to check the quadrant. Numpy has a useful function that checks the quadrant which I use below.

```python

def Decompose_R_ZXY(R):

    #decomposes as RzRXRy. Note the order: ZXY <- rotation by y first
    thetaz = np.arctan2(-R[0,1], R[1,1])
    thetay = np.arctan2(-R[2,0], R[2,2])
    thetax = np.arctan2(R[2,1], np.sqrt(R[2,0]**2 + R[2,2]**2))

    return thetaz, thetay, thetax
```

**3. Define a T pose.**
