Below are links to my project repositories.

**Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation**

Tensorflow implementation of the canonical fusion model presented in the paper "Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation" by Remelli, et al.

**Differentiable Direct Linear Transform**

Tensorflow implementation of differentiable direct linear transform, presented in the paper:
"Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation" by Remelli, et al.

**Python BVH Viewer**

A simple BVH file viewer written to use only python. Joint local and world space coordinates are calculated frame by frame so that they can be saved and used for other projects.
